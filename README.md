## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Dustin Kenefake, a 6th year phd student in the [Pistikopoulos Group](https://parametric.tamu.edu/), where I focus mainly on algorithms and software for optimization. Code that my group has made can be found [here](https://github.com/TAMUparametric). Find out more about my research and myself on my [website](https://dkenefake.github.io/). My hobby projects center around generating random numbers, optimization, and ray tracing.

### Current Open Source Projects
* [PPOPT](https://github.com/TAMUparametric/PPOPT) - A Scalable **multiparametric programming** solver written in **Python**
* [SmallPRNG](https://github.com/DKenefake/SmallPRNG) - A header only extensible **PRNG** library/framework written in **C++** (Tested with [Testu01](http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html))
* [SmolPrng](https://github.com/DKenefake/smolprng) - A high performance extendable **PRNG** crate written in **Rust**
* [FasterFVA](https://github.com/DKenefake/fasterfva) - A **FVA** tool based on a novel algorithm, written in **Python**
* [Hercules](https://github.com/DKenefake/hercules/) - A reseach QUBO solver, written in **Rust** with **Python** Bindings
* [MixingCut](https://github.com/DKenefake/MixingCut) - A SDP solver for the MAXCUT SDP relaxation, written in **Rust**
### Not So Current Projects
* [OptimalPoly](https://github.com/DKenefake/OptimalPoly) - A numerically stable **optimal approximation of functions**, written in **Python**
